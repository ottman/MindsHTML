## Instructions

### Markup

Here's a barebones example of the presentation:
<html>
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reveal.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/white.css">
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="reveal">
			<div class="slides">
				<section>Slide 1</section>
				<section>Slide 2</section>
			</div>
		</div>
		<script src="js/reveal.js"></script>
		<script>
			Reveal.initialize();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

The presentation markup hierarchy needs to be `.reveal > .slides > section` where the `section` represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple `section` elements inside of another `section` they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the "root" of the others (at the top), and will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example:

```html
<div class="reveal">
	<div class="slides">
		<section>Single Horizontal Slide</section>
		<section>
			<section>Vertical Slide 1</section>
			<section>Vertical Slide 2</section>
		</section>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Markdown

It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the ```data-markdown``` attribute to your ```<section>``` elements and wrap the contents in a ```<script type="text/template">``` like the example below.

This is based on [data-markdown](https://gist.github.com/1343518) from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish) modified to use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to support [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks).

```html
<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
		## Page title

		A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).
	</script>
</section>
```


#### Element Attributes

Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things.

```html
<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
		- Item 1 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
		- Item 2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
	</script>
</section>
```

#### Slide Attributes

Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to the slide `<section>` elements generated by your Markdown.

```html
<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
	<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff0000" -->
		Markdown content
	</script>
</section>
```

See below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values:

```javascript
Reveal.initialize({

	...

	// The "normal" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved
	// when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be
	// specified using percentage units.
	width: 960,
	height: 700,

	// Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content
	margin: 0.1,

	// Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content
	minScale: 0.2,
	maxScale: 1.5

});
```


### Dependencies

These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear:

```javascript
Reveal.initialize({
	dependencies: [
		// Cross-browser shim that fully implements classList - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/
		{ src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } },

		// Interpret Markdown in <section> elements
		{ src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },
		{ src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },

		// Syntax highlight for <code> elements
		{ src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } },

		// Zoom in and out with Alt+click
		{ src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true },

		// Speaker notes
		{ src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true },

		// MathJax
		{ src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }
	]
});
```

You can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object:
- **src**: Path to the script to load
- **async**: [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false
- **callback**: [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded
- **condition**: [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded


### Ready Event

```javascript
Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) {
	// event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
```


### Auto-sliding

Presentations can be configured to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides:

```javascript
// Slide every five seconds
Reveal.configure({
  autoSlide: 5000
});
```
When this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Alternatively, sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing »a« on the keyboard. Sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying ```autoSlideStoppable: false``` in your reveal.js config.

You can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the ```data-autoslide``` attribute:

```html
<section data-autoslide="2000">
	<p>After 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown.</p>
	<p class="fragment" data-autoslide="10000">After 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown.</p>
	<p class="fragment">Now, the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown.</p>
</section>
```

Whenever the auto-slide mode is resumed or paused the ```autoslideresumed``` and ```autoslidepaused``` events are fired.


### Keyboard Bindings

If you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the ```keyboard``` config option:

```javascript
Reveal.configure({
  keyboard: {
    13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed
    27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed
    32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding)
  }
});
```

### Touch Navigation

You can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch-enabled device. Horizontal swipes change between horizontal slides, vertical swipes change between vertical slides. If you wish to disable this you can set the `touch` config option to false when initializing reveal.js.

If there's some part of your content that needs to remain accessible to touch events you'll need to highlight this by adding a `data-prevent-swipe` attribute to the element. One common example where this is useful is elements that need to be scrolled.


### Lazy Loading

When working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content it's important to load lazily. Lazy loading means that reveal.js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide. The number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the `viewDistance` configuration option.

To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your "src" attributes to "data-src" as shown below. This is supported for image, video, audio and iframe elements. Lazy loaded iframes will also unload when the containing slide is no longer visible.

```html
<section>
  <img data-src="image.png">
  <iframe data-src="http://hakim.se"></iframe>
  <video>
    <source data-src="video.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <source data-src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</section>
```



### Slide Changed Event

A 'slidechanged' event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes.

Some libraries, like MathJax (see [#226](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/226#issuecomment-10261609)), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback.

```javascript
Reveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {
	// event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
```

### Presentation State

The presentation's current state can be fetched by using the `getState` method. A state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when `getState` was first called. Sort of like a snapshot. It's a simple object that can easily be stringified and persisted or sent over the wire.

```javascript
Reveal.slide( 1 );
// we're on slide 1

var state = Reveal.getState();

Reveal.slide( 3 );
// we're on slide 3

Reveal.setState( state );
// we're back on slide 1
```

### Slide States

If you set ``data-state="somestate"`` on a slide ``<section>``, "somestate" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide.

Furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript:

```javascript
Reveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() {
	// TODO: Sprinkle magic
}, false );
```

### Slide Backgrounds

Slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a ```data-background``` attribute to your ```<section>``` elements. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe. Below are a few examples.

```html
<section data-background="#ff0000">
	<h2>All CSS color formats are supported, like rgba() or hsl().</h2>
</section>
<section data-background="http://example.com/image.png">
	<h2>This slide will have a full-size background image.</h2>
</section>
<section data-background="http://example.com/image.png" data-background-size="100px" data-background-repeat="repeat">
	<h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated.</h2>
</section>
<section data-background-video="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4,https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.webm" data-background-video-loop>
	<h2>Video. Multiple sources can be defined using a comma separated list. Video will loop when the data-background-video-loop attribute is provided.</h2>
</section>
<section data-background-iframe="https://slides.com">
	<h2>Embeds a web page as a background. Note that the page won't be interactive.</h2>
</section>
```

Backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing ```backgroundTransition: 'slide'``` to the ```Reveal.initialize()``` call. Alternatively you can set ```data-background-transition``` on any section with a background to override that specific transition.


### Parallax Background

If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the first two config properties below when initializing reveal.js (the other two are optional).

```javascript
Reveal.initialize({

	// Parallax background image
	parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg"

	// Parallax background size
	parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. "2100px 900px" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto)

	// Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide
	// - Calculated automatically unless specified
	// - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis
	parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: 200,
	parallaxBackgroundVertical: 50

});
```

Make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. [View example](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?parallaxBackgroundImage=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fhakim-static%2Freveal-js%2Freveal-parallax-1.jpg&parallaxBackgroundSize=2100px%20900px).



### Slide Transitions
The global presentation transition is set using the ```transition``` config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the ```data-transition``` attribute:

```html
<section data-transition="zoom">
	<h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2>
</section>

<section data-transition-speed="fast">
	<h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2>
</section>
```

You can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide:

```html
<section data-transition="slide">
    The train goes on … 
</section>
<section data-transition="slide"> 
    and on … 
</section>
<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out"> 
    and stops.
</section>
<section data-transition="fade-in slide-out"> 
    (Passengers entering and leaving)
</section>
<section data-transition="slide">
    And it starts again.
</section>
```


### Internal links

It's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute (```<section id="some-slide">```):

```html
<a href="#/2/2">Link</a>
<a href="#/some-slide">Link</a>
```

You can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an ```enabled``` class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide.

```html
<a href="#" class="navigate-left">
<a href="#" class="navigate-right">
<a href="#" class="navigate-up">
<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
<a href="#" class="navigate-prev"> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide -->
<a href="#" class="navigate-next"> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide -->
```


### Fragments
Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class ```fragment``` will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments

The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment:

```html
<section>
	<p class="fragment grow">grow</p>
	<p class="fragment shrink">shrink</p>
	<p class="fragment fade-out">fade-out</p>
	<p class="fragment current-visible">visible only once</p>
	<p class="fragment highlight-current-blue">blue only once</p>
	<p class="fragment highlight-red">highlight-red</p>
	<p class="fragment highlight-green">highlight-green</p>
	<p class="fragment highlight-blue">highlight-blue</p>
</section>
```

Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second.

```html
<section>
	<span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I'll fade in, then out</span>
	</span>
</section>
```

The display order of fragments can be controlled using the ```data-fragment-index``` attribute.

```html
<section>
	<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Appears last</p>
	<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Appears first</p>
	<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Appears second</p>
</section>
```
